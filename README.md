# UHPC-HRC-limitstates
Parametric modeling and limit state prediction for reinforced UHPC flexural beams using a closed-form analytical framework.
This repository implements the analytical framework presented in the paper "Parametric Modeling of Limit States for Hybrid Reinforced UHPC Flexural Beams". The model computes full flexural responses (moment-curvature and load-deflection) using material-specific quadrilinear tension, bilinear compression, and reinforcement models. It supports evaluation of key performance-based and material limit states, and enables design, validation, and inverse-analysis for UHPC and FRC beam systems.

The package includes all core model functions, plotting tools, deflection calculations, and example scripts to simulate experimental setups and perform case studies.
